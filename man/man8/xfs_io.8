.SH NAME
xfs_io \- debug the I/O path of an XFS filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f3xfs_io\f1 [ \f3\-c\f1 cmd ] ... [ \f3\-p\f1 prog ] [ \f3\-adFfmrRstx\f1 ] file
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f2xfs_io\f1 is a debugging tool like \f2xfs_db\f1, but is aimed
at examining the regular file I/O path rather than the raw XFS volume
itself.
.PP
The options to \f2xfs_io\f1 are:
.TP 10
\f3\-c\f1 \f2cmd\f1
\f2xfs_io\f1 commands may be run interactively (the default)
or as arguments on the command line.
Multiple \f3\-c\f1 arguments may be given.
The commands are run in the sequence given, then the program exits.
.TP
\f3\-p\f1 \f2prog\f1
Set the program name for prompts and some error messages,
the default value is \f2xfs_io\f1.
.TP
\f3\-F\f1
Allow \f2file\f1 to reside in non-XFS (foreign) filesystems.
This mode has a restricted set of commands.
.TP
\f3\-f\f1
Create \f2file\f1 if it does not already exist.
.TP
\f3\-r\f1
Open \f2file\f1 read-only, initially.
.TP
\f3\-x\f1
Expert mode.
Dangerous commands are only available in this mode.
These commands also tend to require additional privileges.
.PP
The other \f2open\f1(2) options described below are also available
from the command line.
.SH CONCEPTS
\f2xfs_io\f1 maintains a number of open files and memory mappings.
Files can be initially opened on the command line (optionally),
and additional files can also be opened later.
.PP
\f2xfs_io\f1 commands can be broken up into three groups.
Some commands are aimed at doing regular file I/O - read, write,
sync, space preallocation, etc.
.PP
The second set of commands exist for manipulating memory mapped regions
of a file - mapping, accessing, storing, unmapping, flushing, etc.
.PP
The remaining commands are for the navigation and display of data
structures relating to the open files, mappings, and the filesystems
where they reside.
.PP
Many commands have extensive online help.
Use the \f3help\f1 command for more details on any command.

file before writing.
.br
The \f3\-i\f1 option allows an input file to be specified as the source
of the data to be written.
.br
The \f3\-d\f1 option will cause direct I/O, rather than the usual buffered
I/O, to be used when reading the input file.
.br
The \f3\-s\f1 options specifies the number of bytes to skip from the
start of the input file before starting to read.

.TP
\f3extsize\f1 [ \f2\-R\f1 | \f2\-D\f1 ] [ \f2value\f1 ]
Display and/or modify the preferred extent size used when allocating
space for the currently open file.
If the \f2-R\f1 option is specified, a recursive descent is performed
for all directory entries below the currently open file (\f2-D\f1 can
be used to restrict the output to directories only).
If the target file is a directory, then the inherited extent size
is set for that directory (new files created in that directory
inherit that extent size).
The \f2value\f1 should be specified in bytes, or using one of the
usual units suffixes (k, m, g, b, etc).
The extent size is always reported in units of bytes.
.TP

system call described in the \f2xfs\f1 manual page.
.TP
\f3unresvsp\f1 \f2offset\f1 \f2length\f1

.TP
\f3sendfile\f1 \f2\-i infile\f1 | \f2\-f N\f1 [ \f2offset\f1 \f2length\f1 ]
On platforms which support it, allows a direct in-kernel copy between
two file descriptors.
The current open file is the target, the source must be specified as
another open file (\f2-f\f1) or by path (\f2-i\f2).

.SH MEMORY MAPPED I/O COMMANDS
.TP
\f3mmap\f1 [ \f2-rwx\f1 ] [[ N ] | [ \f2offset\f1 \f2length\f1 ]]
With no arguments, \f3mmap\f1 shows the current mappings.
Specifying a single numeric argument sets the current mapping.
If two arguments are specified (a range), a new mapping is created
spanning the range, and the protection mode can be given as a combination of
PROT_READ (\f2-r\f1), PROT_WRITE (\f2-w\f1), and PROT_EXEC (\f2-x\f1).
.TP
\f3mm\f1
See the \f3mmap\f1 command.
.TP
\f3munmap\f1
Unmaps the current memory mapping.
.TP
\f3mu\f1
See the \f3munmap\f1 command.
.TP
\f3mread\f1 [ \-\f2frv\f1 ]
Accesses a segment of the current memory mapping, optionally dumping it to
the standard output stream (with \f2-v\f1 or \f2-f\f1 option) for inspection.
The accesses are performed sequentially from the start offset by default,
but can also be done from the end backwards through the mapping if
the \f2-r\f1 option in specified.
The two verbose modes differ only in the relative offsets they display,
the \f2-f\f1 option is relative to file start, whereas \f2-v\f1 shows
offsets relative to the start of the mapping.
.TP
\f3mr\f1
See the \f3mread\f1 command.
.TP
\f3mwrite\f1 [ \f2-r\f1 ] [ \f2-S seed\f1 ]
Stores a byte into memory for a range within a mapping.
The default stored value is 'X', repeated to fill the range specified,
but this can be changed using the \f2-S\f1 option.
The memory stores are performed sequentially from the start offset by default,
but can also be done from the end backwards through the mapping if the \-\f2r\f1
option in specified.
.TP
\f3mw\f1
See the \f3mwrite\f1 command.
.TP
\f3msync\f1
Writes all modified copies of pages over the specified range (or entire
mapping if no range specified) to their backing storage locations.
Also, optionally invalidates (\f2-i\f1) so that subsequent references to
the pages will be obtained from their backing storage locations (instead
of cached copies).
The flush can be done synchronously (\f2-s\f1) or asynchronously (\f2-a\f1).
.TP
\f3ms\f1
See the \f3msync\f1 command.
.TP
\f3madvise\f1 [ \-\f2drwsw\f1 ] [ \f2offset\f1 \f2length\f1 ]
Modifies page cache behavior when operating on the current mapping.
The range arguments are required by some advise commands ([*] below).
With no arguments, the POSIX_MADV_NORMAL advice is implied (default readahead).
The \f2-d\f1 option says the pages will not be needed (POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED[*]).
The \f2-r\f1 option says to expect random page references (POSIX_MADV_RANDOM),
which sets readahead to zero.
The \f2-s\f1 option says to expect sequential page references
(POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL), which doubles the default readahead on the file.
The \f2-w\f1 option advises the specified pages will be needed
again (POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED[*]) which forces the maximum readahead.
.TP
\f3mincore\f1
Dumps a list of pages or ranges of pages that are currently in core,
for the current memory mapping.

.SH OTHER COMMANDS
.TP
\f3print\f1
Display a list of all open files and memory mapped regions.
The current file and current mapping are distinguishable from
any others.
.TP
\f3p\f1
See the \f3print\f1 command.
.TP
\f3quit\f1
Exit \f2xfs_io\f1.
.TP
\f3q\f1

.TP
\f3lsattr\f1 [ \f2\-R\f1 | \f2\-D\f1 | \f2\-a\f1 | \f2\-v\f1 ]
List extended inode flags on the currently open file.
If the \f2-R\f1 option is specified, a recursive descent is performed
for all directory entries below the currently open file (\f2-D\f1 can
be used to restrict the output to directories only).
This is a depth first descent, it does not follow symlinks and
it also does not cross mount points.
.TP
\f3chattr\f1 [ \f2\-R\f1 | \f2\-D\f1 ] [ \f2+/\-riasAdtPn\f1 ]
Change extended inode flags on the currently open file.
The \f2-R\f1 and \f2-D\f1 options have the same meaning as above.
The mapping between each letter and the inode flags (refer to
\f2xfsctl\f1(3) for the full list) is available via the \f3help\f1 command.
.TP
\f3freeze\f1
Suspend all write I/O requests to the filesystem of the current file.
Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.
.TP
\f3thaw\f1
Undo the effects of a filesystem freeze operation.
Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.
.TP
\f3inject\f1 [ \f2tag\f1 ]
Inject errors into a filesystem to observe filesystem behavior at
specific points under adverse conditions.
Without an argument, displays the list of error tags available.
Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.
.TP
\f3resblks\f1 [ \f2blocks\f1 ]
Get and/or set count of reserved filesystem blocks using the
XFS_IOC_GET_RESBLKS or XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS system calls.
Note \-\- this can be useful for exercising out of space behavior.
Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.
.TP
\f3shutdown\f1 [ \f2\-f\f1 ]
Force the filesystem to shutdown (with or without flushing the log).
Only available in expert mode and requires privileges.
.TP
\f3stat\f1 [ \f2\-v\f1 ]
Selected statistics from \f2stat\f1(2) and the XFS_IOC_GETXATTR
system call on the current file.
If the \f2-v\f1 option is specified, the atime (last access), mtime
(last modify), and ctime (last change) timestamps are also displayed.
.TP
\f3statfs\f1
Selected statistics from \f2statfs\f1(2) and the XFS_IOC_FSGEOMETRY
system call on the filesystem where the current file resides.
.TP
\f3parent\f1 [ \f2\-cpv\f1 ]
By default this command prints out the parent inode numbers,
inode generation numbers and basenames of all the hardlinks which
point to the inode of the current file.
If the \f2-p\f1 option is specified, then the output is similar 
to the default output except pathnames up to the mount-point
are printed out instead of the component name.
If the \f2-c\f1 option is specified, then the file's filesystem
will check all the parent attributes for consistency. 
If the \f2-v\f1 option is specified, then verbose output will be
printed.
Not currently operational on Linux.
