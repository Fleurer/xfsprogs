.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xfs_freeze
suspends and resumes access to an XFS filesystem (see
.IR xfs (5)).
The
.I mount-point
argument is the pathname of the directory where the filesystem
is mounted.
The filesystem must be mounted to be frozen (see
.IR mount (8)).
.I xfs_freeze
is intended to be used with volume managers and hardware raid devices
which support the creation of snapshots,
.I xfs_freeze
will halt new access to the filesystem and create a stable image on disk 
suitable for using as a snapshot.
.PP
Using the \f3\-f\f1 option, the filesystem is locked out from new
modifications, write system calls are halted on entry, other calls
which modify the filesystem are halted at the start of a transaction,
all ongoing transactions in the filesystem are allowed to complete.
.PP
All dirty data is written out to disk, the log is flushed to disk and
all dirty metadata is written out. The \f3\-u\f1 option is then used
to unfreeze the filesystem and allow operations to continue.
