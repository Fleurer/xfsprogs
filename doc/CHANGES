	- Fix up log stripe unit specification options, and update
	  man page.  Also fix suffix handling for data su/sw options

	  part of a striped disk
	- Fix an off-by-one error on rounding down an AG that is
	  too small to be an AG
	- Don't auto-grow the log to be larger than an AG
	- Change the error philosophy for -d su=,sw= away from forcing

	- Bumped version of libhandle to libhandle.so.1.0.1
	  This changes open_by_handle() and friends so that

	  2^31-1 bytes instead of not dumping the large
	  files and giving warning messages.

	- implement the -f (file) option to xfs_logprint
	- rework the xlog code into libxlog for code sharing
